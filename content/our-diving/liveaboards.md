#### LIVEABOARD DIVING

<span class="strapline">Taking you to the best of the islands' remote locations </span>



The world-famous dive sites of Wolf and Darwin are far from land and not accessible when day diving.  Taking a liveaboard to these and some of our other wonderful, but remote, dive locations is the way to see the very best of the Galapagos.

We can arrange your trip on a number of different specialised ultra-long-range dive boats, each offering a particular level of comfort and style - and a choice of diving itineraries. So, rather than spending your precious time personally contacting many operators, let us do the work for you!  

Just decide whether you want to master solely on Wolf and Darwin or also include other remote, distant, coastlines, where other varieties of exotic species are found.  Whatever your preference, let us know and we’ll do the rest!

<B>Please note,</B> the northern sites of the Galapagos (Wolf and Darwin) are famous for the large schools of Scalloped Hammerheads, perhaps most especially so on Darwin during the warm season (January to May).  Whale Sharks are generally around between June and November, Manta Rays between October and December, Dolphins, Galapagos Sharks, Silky Sharks, Mola Mola, White Spotted Eagle Rays, are to be expected through most of the year.

<B>Also be aware,</B> boats are heavily booked in advance for the Whale Shark season, so it’s advisable to reserve your place/s at least a year in advance.  That said, there are occasional last-minute cancellations so do give us a try - especially if you’re visiting between January and May.


Some of the liveaboards we can arrange for you to join are set out below.  If one of these is of interest, or you have a specific vessel that you would like to join, please let us know, especially if you are looking for a last-minute price.  

<I>Liveaboard operators expect clients to have significant dive experience before booking, with most looking for between 50 and 100 dives in the recent past.  Please bear this in mind when considering this form of visit.</I>
