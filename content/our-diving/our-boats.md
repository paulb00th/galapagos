#### OUR BOATS

<span class="strapline">The platforms we rely upon </span>

Our boats are designed and equipped for comfort, safety, and seaworthiness, in the conditions that prevail in the Galapagos. 

Our own vessel, NINA, which we use for novice and refresher courses, is 7 m long and powered by an outboard engine that helps us to easily navigate to and from dive sites we use for training but is eco-friendly by way of displacement/horsepower.   It has plenty of space for dry and wet storage and for kitting-up.

If you select us as your provider for longer-range day diving, (suitable for the more advanced diver), you will travel on one of a number of select boats that, again, have been chosen by us for their comfort, safety and good seakeeping.  Typically, these are between 10 and 12 m length and of fibre-glass construction, with twin 200HP outboards, and the following security equipment: radio VHF, EPIRB, GPS, and oxygen.  The long -ange day boats we use generally carry a maximum of 12 clients, offer a private head (sea toilet) and are usually staffed by a minimum of two guides/instructors, two crew members and a qualified captain.
