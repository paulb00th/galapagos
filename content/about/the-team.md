##### Claudia Molina - PADI IDC Staff Instructor and co-owner.

{{< figure src="/img/about/A-Us-ClaudiaMolina.png" class="align-right full-width">}}

I grew up in Brazil, living close to the sea, and quickly learned to love the marine world.  

I moved to Ecuador at the age of 16 to study Ecological Tourism in Quito.  Following this, I arrived in the Galapagos for the first time in 2001, when I initially experienced diving.  I knew immediately that I would seek employment in the dive industry, and I became a PADI Instructor in 2004, thereafter working in Brazil, and Honduras before returning to the Galapagos.  

It’s the islands here (and my Ecuadorian husband) that have captured my heart - and now I’m here to stay.
 
I’ve worked with all of the best operators across the islands, forged great relations with them, and certified over 600 PADI students in recent years. When I’m not working on behalf of our dive or film companies, I’m to be found enjoying the sun’s rays and playing in the sea alongside my husband, Juan Carlos, and our two children.

##### Juan-Carlos Balda - PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer and co-owner.

I was born in Guayaquil in southern Ecuador and fell in love with marine animals and the unique character of the underwater world at a very young age, thanks to my family.  

Dedicating my life to diving and natural history seemed a powerful way to teach others about the wonders of the sea and the need for us to take far better care of it.   

I have been a diver since 2001 and a PADI Instructor since 2008, certifying some 300 students over the last 15 years.  

Alongside Claudia, I’ve been developing our business supporting international film crews working in the islands and today, my roles are split between teaching and supporting documentary makers.

##### Mathieu Idrovo - PADI Instructor 

{{< figure src="/img/about/A-Us-ClaudiaMolina.png" class="align-right full-width">}}

I’ve grown up in the Galapagos Islands. 

My first PADI dive was made at the age of 12 and the marine world has fascinated me ever since.  

I soon obtained my EFR certification, and I went on from that to gain my Open Water Instructor certification in Cozumel, Mexico.

Apart from instruction, I love exploration diving, sailing, and kayaking.  So, when not working, I can most often be found indulging these interests in the expansive and fascinating bay adjacent to Puerto Ayora.

Apart from working with Claudia and Juan-Carlos, I’m employed at the town’s Hyperbaric Chamber where I’m a certified operator.

##### Sofia Geen - Divemaster

Sofía Green Iturralde is a marine biologist and divemaster from Ecuador. 

Sophia has been working in the Galapagos Islands as a scientific researcher, diver, and wildlife photographer since 2017, and working as a divemaster and lecturer on board educational expeditions since 2021. 

Sophia's main scientific focus has been on the the whale shark population in the islands, as she has worked collaboratively with a research project led by a local Galapagos organisation. 

When you dive with Sofia you will experience her passion for sea life and discover how you can work as a citizen scientist in support of marine conservation.
