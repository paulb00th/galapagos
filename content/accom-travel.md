#### ACCOMODATION & TRAVEL

We live and work in the Galapagos and know most of the local service providers offering both accommodation and transport.  

Whether you are looking for a small studio, an apartment, a ‘standard’, ‘comfort’ or ‘superior’ hotel - or something considerably higher end - let us help you organise your perfect stay by guiding you to the best accommodation outcome. 

In regard to moving about during your visit, we can advise on low-cost public transport options - on both land and water, as well as your choices regarding private vessels, taxis and hire cars. Just ask us…

To help make the most of your stay, why not have us organise an integrated travel and accommodation plan, so that you’re free to focus on the bigger picture! Link to Contact us
