{{< readmore "readMore1" "hiddenText1" >}}
There are several excellent scuba operators servicing the Galapagos, but each primarily specialises in taking qualified divers to distant sites - which are often very challenging for trainees.  **Galapagos Dive Academy**, founded by husband and wife team Claudia and Juan-Carlos, offers a service that negates this difficulty by providing high quality instruction to novice divers in the safe waters of Academy Bay.  This perfect training environment, set adjacent to the Charles Darwin Centre in Puerto Ayora, (the largest town in the Galapagos), has dive sites just 10 minutes from the town’s harbour.

Let **Galapagos Dive Academy** teach you to the highest of standards in the safest of places.  We also offer refresher courses in Academy Bay, and diving for those seeking to test-out new equipment before embarking on an extended trip.

**Galapagos Dive Academy** is co-located alongside DAN, (Diver’s Alert Network), the world’s most recognised and respected dive safety organisation, in the recently developed centre housing Santa Cruz Island’s main decompression chamber.

Besides offering the highest quality dive training, Galapagos Dive Academy specialises in providing:

1) Access to the best and most professional dive and land-based operators on the islands; perfect for clients who are newly qualified and confident to move out into the big blue, or who simply want to take a break from the water and explore the wonders of Galapagos verde.

2) Support for international film crews working in the islands.  If you’ve seen the BBC’s Blue Planet presented by David Attenborough or [My Family & The Galapagos](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/my-family-and-the-galapagos), presented by Monty Halls, Claudia and Juan-Carlos were involved, organising the logistics of the shoots.  They regularly provide crews with safety-diver cover, remove camping services, and assistance with filming permits, dive boats and captains, specialised guides, supplies, transportation and accommodation.

Together, Claudia and Juan-Carlos bring more than 35 years of dive industry expertise to everything they do.  Selecting **Galapagos Dive Academy** as the partner for your trip is a great way to improve the experience of a lifetime.
